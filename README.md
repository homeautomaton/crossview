Library and sample program for manipulating Lacrosse brand clock without La Cross View phone app

The LaCrosse projection clock C82929 can display arbitrary text messages and has an app that can
also set or enable/disable the alarm.

This library and sample program enables setting the messages or alarm without using the phone app.
My hope is that the maintainers of the LaCrosse View integration for Home Assistant can build on
this and allow users to send info to their clocks, or even change their wake-up time based on traffic!
